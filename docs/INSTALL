INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

Matchseq is a CGI program that matches sequences against references in the fish
pathogen database.


Prerequisites
-------------

This is a Python script that uses the WSGI interface, and as such requires Python 2.6+

Two libraraies must be installed for this Python:

- BioPython
- MySQLdb (for the databse access)

In addition a number of external binaries are called by the script

- Mafft
- Qjoin
- Fasta (a recent version)


Installing the script
---------------------

Drop this unpacked archive into the appropriate cgi-bin directory.

Permissions will have to be set appropriately so that the main script is served
as CGI, and assets (images, stylesheets etc.) are served as normal. Something
like this is required (which is served from http://cgi.agapow.net/cgi-bin)::

        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/sites/cgi.agapow.net/public/cgi-bin/
        <Directory "/var/www/sites/cgi.agapow.net/public/cgi-bin/">
                AllowOverride None
                Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
                # dot is optional in specification
                AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
                AddHandler default-handler .html .htm .gif .jpg .js .css
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all
        </Directory>

Note that the databse connection details are contained in a Python file, so
these should not be served.

All configuration details are found in the file ``config.py``. (Update: some
appearance and routing details are in ``view/config.py`` but imported into
the above config file.) Edit these as required:

- DB_CHOICE: set this to something other than 'test_sqlite' to use the
  production db details
- DB_TYPE, DB_HOST, etc.: set these to the appropriate production db details.
  They should be correct already.
- EXEPATHS: set these to the appropriate paths for the necessary executables.
  It is probably safer to have it set to absolute paths.

The apparent paths are:

/home/tgray/apps/quick-join-1.0.10
/home/tgray/apps/fasta-35.4.11
/home/tgray/apps/mafft


If the appearance of the page needs to be altered, the relevant layouots can be
found in ``views/templates``, in particular the ``PAGES`` variable.


Possible errors
---------------

*error message about missing Bio.something*: install Biopython

*error message about missing wsgiref*: Python version must be 2.6+


Development
-----------

When developing or testing matchseq, the following points are of interest:

* Pertinent details in config.py need to be altered, specifically the
  development mode and the database connection details

* If run in development mode, a mock server is set up. This will not serve
  static assets (css, images etc.) You will need to alter the address and port
  for serving.

* The mock server can be run ``python matchseq,cgi``. If it returns the source
  for the page immediately, you've left it in production mode.

* Note that while the mock server is running, changes to the source may not be
  reflected in the served content.
